0.022  Thu Apr  10 08:35:00 2014
        - refactored
        - added more documentation
        - added rule chain using Procmail's carbon-copy flags (used for archive)
        - added subject filtering conversion
        - added inbox directory as catchall rule (mails that came from other rules chains
          that did not have an archive rule)
        - added escaping for filter field values
        - debug mode(--debug) is now functional, it inserts a X-Procmail-Debug: <n> 
          with the number of the rule that the mail matched
        - removed the ending column so that procmail
          takes care of locking. read more about this here 
          http://pm-doc.sourceforge.net/doc/#local_lockfile_usage
        - added rule_body to convert "hasTheWord" gmail filters
